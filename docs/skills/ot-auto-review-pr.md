# ot-auto-review-pr

> 🤖 Autonomous — runs end-to-end without supervision

Reviews or re-reviews a PR by number in an isolated worktree, leaving your current worktree untouched. It fetches the exact PR from the tracker, runs the code-review engine (or a specification review for spec-only design PRs), submits an approve/request-changes verdict, and manages the pipeline labels. When changes are requested it immediately enters an autonomous autofix loop — resolving conflicts, fixing code, adding tests, validating, and re-reviewing — until the PR is genuinely merge-ready or only a non-actionable blocker remains. Usage: `/ot-auto-review-pr <PR-number>`.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `{prNumber}` | Yes | The PR number to review or re-review, e.g. `1234`. |
| `--force` | No | Bypass the in-progress concurrency check; use when intentionally taking over a PR another auto-skill or human already claimed. |

## Works with

Consumes a `{prNumber}` (the `PR:` reference line a PR-producing skill emitted), reviews that existing PR, and ends by reporting its verdict (`APPROVED` / `CHANGES REQUESTED`) plus the `PR:` reference line (and `Issue:` when known) for the next skill in a chain. It runs [ot-code-review](ot-code-review.md) verbatim as its review engine inside the isolated worktree, and is itself invoked by chain skills such as [ot-auto-fix-issue](ot-auto-fix-issue.md), [ot-auto-fix-pr](ot-auto-fix-pr.md), and [ot-auto-qa-pr](ot-auto-qa-pr.md).
