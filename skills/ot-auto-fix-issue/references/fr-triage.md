# FR triage gate — is this an unbuilt feature?

The gate `ot-auto-fix-issue`'s **feature route** runs (step F1) before
touching a worktree. It asks: is this really a feature request, is the feature
not already implemented, and is the ticket ready to be built from? Operate
**read-only** — file reads, code search, and read-only tracker operations
(**get-issue**, **search-prs**, **search-issues**, **repo-info**,
**current-user**) only. No edits, commits, claims, or branch creation. The single
exception is the idempotent not-ready comment in section 4: find its marker via
**list-issue-comments**, post it via **comment-issue** on the first run, and rewrite
it via **update-comment** when its missing-items list changes.

## Decision procedure

Run in order; the first stop wins. Bias toward stopping — when you cannot defend
"real, unbuilt feature" with at least one piece of evidence, stop.

### 1. Is the issue closed or already in progress by someone else?

If `state` is `closed`, stop with `NO_ACTION_NEEDED`. If the three-signal lock
(step 1 of the body) shows another actor owns it, stop with `NO_ACTION_NEEDED` and
name the owner. (Stale-lock recovery per the body: a lock older than 60 minutes
with no activity is not a stop on its own.)

### 2. Is it a feature request, or actually a bug?

Re-check the step-2 classification (label-first, then content — the same
feature-vs-bug signals). If the issue is clearly a **bug**, stop this feature route
with `NO_ACTION_NEEDED` and state that it belongs on `ot-auto-fix-issue`'s bug
chain. When an issue mixes a defect and a new capability, prefer stopping and
recommend the user split it (the bug goes to the bug chain, the FR stays on the
feature route) rather than guessing.

### 3. Is the feature already implemented, or already in flight?

Before writing any spec, prove the feature does not already exist:

- **Code search** the repository for the capability the issue asks for — the
  endpoint/route, command, flag, screen, config key, or public function it names.
  A matching, working implementation (with tests) means the feature exists → stop
  with `NO_ACTION_NEEDED`, citing the file/symbol.
- **Specs directory** (`$SPECS_DIR`, plus the repo's design-doc areas): read the
  TLDR/overview of candidate specs. A spec that already fully covers the ask is
  reused later (step F3), **not** a stop — note its path and continue. A spec plus
  an **open PR or merged PR/commit** already delivering it is a stop with
  `NO_ACTION_NEEDED` (search via **search-prs** for `#{issueId}` and for the
  feature name; scan `origin/$BASE_BRANCH` history).
- Scan recent issue comments for `implemented in`, `shipped in`, `duplicate of`,
  `superseded by` and follow the links.

### 4. Is the ticket ready to be built from?

Read the **Definition of Ready** in the repo's `SDLC.md` (default to this
collection's own two-tier list when the file has none) and check the issue against
its **ticket-level** tier only: the problem and who has it, the expected outcome
and how it is checked, what is out of scope, no blocking open question left
unanswered, and any autonomous assumption already confirmed by a human. A
maintainer's explicit waiver on the ticket ("ready as is") satisfies the tier.

Spec-level items — acceptance criteria, business rules, paths, data and
permissions, dependencies, prototype link — are **not** checked here: a covering
spec supplies them, and step F3c authors one when it is missing.

When a ticket-level item is missing, post one idempotent comment (marker
`` 🤖 `ot-auto-fix-issue` — not ready ``, the same shape
`ot-auto-manage-issues` uses: the missing items as a list, addressed to the
author, with the waiver sentence). Find it via **list-issue-comments**, update it
in place via **update-comment** when the missing-items list changes, and skip the
mutation when it already reflects the current state. Then stop with `NOT_READY`.
Never fill the gap yourself — a guessed problem statement is the failure this
gate exists to prevent.

## Output contract

**Stop the run** (not ready):

```
NOT_READY
<one paragraph: which ticket-level items are missing, and that the not-ready
comment on the issue lists them for the author>
```

The literal token `NOT_READY` on its own line triggers the clean stop; the
reporting in step F4 passes the missing items through.

**Stop the run** (no action needed):

```
NO_ACTION_NEEDED
<one paragraph: why — cite file paths/symbols, PR numbers, commit hashes, or the
bug-vs-feature classification and the ot-auto-fix-issue hand-off, as evidence>
```

The literal token `NO_ACTION_NEEDED` on its own line triggers the clean stop.

**Proceed:**

```
<one short paragraph confirming this is a real, unbuilt feature request; note
whether an existing spec in $SPECS_DIR covers it (path) or a fresh spec is needed,
and the area of the codebase the implementation will touch>
```

Keep it tight (≤200 words). The spec-writing step designs the feature; do not
design it here.
