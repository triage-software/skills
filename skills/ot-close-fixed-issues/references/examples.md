## Missing closing keywords

```markdown
⚠️ `ot-close-fixed-issues` closed 0 issues; two PRs mention open issues without recognized closing links.

| PR | Open issue | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| #91 | #88 | `Zamyka #88` is not a configured closing keyword. |
| #90 | #62 | `Naprawia #62` is not a configured closing keyword. |

No custom `closeKeywords` are configured. If these phrases mean the issues are
fixed, add `"closeKeywords": ["zamyka", "naprawia"]` to `.ai/agentic.config.json`
and rerun. Neither issue was changed.
```
