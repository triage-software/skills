# Interview rounds (step 3)

How `ot-discover` asks. The body's rules are the contract; this file is technique.

## Sources before questions

The ladder, in order: the research directory → the repository → the tracker (read-only, when available) → benchmarks the user points at → the user. Ask the user directly only what has no other source: motivation, appetite, constraints, priorities, taste, and every decision. A question whose answer sits in a file is homework the agent does first.

## Frontier rounds

Map the brief as a tree of questions: every settled answer opens the questions that depended on it. The **frontier** is every question that can be asked now without guessing at an answer not yet heard. Ask the frontier in one round, numbered, at most eight questions — when the frontier is larger, ask the eight that unblock the most brief sections and carry the rest to the next round; give the recommended answer for each, and the evidence tier that answer would carry if accepted. Wait for the user. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another still open in this round belongs to a later round. Two rounds are the norm, three the ceiling unless the user asks for more; what is still open after that goes to the collection plan or the open questions, not to a fourth round.

Format a round like so, in the interviewer's voice from `references/voice.md` (plain words, the user's language, one concrete thing per question):

```
**Q1 — {plain title, six words or fewer}.**
Why I ask: {one line pointing at what in the material raised it}
Question: {the question, with two or three named options when it is a choice, and an example of a good answer}
My suggestion: {the answer, in plain words} ({what it rests on: "your interview of 20 August", "the board", or "a guess, nothing in the material"})
If you don't know yet: {what goes on the collection plan, and who could answer}

**Q2 — …**
```

The evidence tier the answer would carry is recorded by the agent when the answer comes back; it is not vocabulary for the question. Before the round goes out, run the self-check in `references/voice.md`.

A question that carries a skeptic CRITICAL finding is asked without a recommendation — recommending an answer to it is resolving it.

When a frontier question needs a fact from the material or the repository, look it up before the round (a sub-agent may do it while the round runs); do not block the rest of the frontier on it, and never ask the user for a fact you could read. When the recommended answer would be an assumption, say so in the round — the user may still choose it, and the brief will carry the tag.

In `own` mode, every suggestion gets a one-line counter-argument next to it (`Against: …`), in the same plain words. Recommendations anchor; the counter-argument is the cheapest defence against the team confirming its own idea.

## Housekeeping before the round

Four things are settled in one plain line each, before Q1, and never take a seat among the eight:

- the mode: detected and confirmed in workflow step 1, before the context gate;
- where the brief lands: `SPECS_DIR` from the config, `.ai/specs` without one (never a question);
- who owns the brief: the person running the session, confirmed with the final yes in step 7;
- a missing name: when the material says "both founders" or "the team" and only one name is known, ask "Who is the second founder?" without a recommendation or a counter-argument.

## The round ends when

- every brief section either has content with a tag, or sits on the collection plan;
- every decision the brief will carry has a named human owner, or the user has declined to name one and the decision is written as a `proposal` with a blocking question;
- no blocking open question is left unanswered by the person who can answer it;
- the user signals enough — depth is their call, not the skill's.

Depth follows risk: a small, reversible product decision gets one short round; a client workshop or a new product gets as many as the material supports. The gate is the collection plan, not the number of rounds.

## Question ladders per mode

**`existing`.** What is the goal and the metric with today's baseline? What must not change (flows, data, integrations, SLAs)? Which users and screens are touched, and which are not? Which compatibility surfaces from `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md` are in play, and what is the migration and rollback path? What does the data say about how the current flow is used, and what does support say about where it hurts?

**`client`.** What decision must this session produce? Who decides, who pays, who uses, who can block? What does each of them call success, and where do those definitions disagree? What are the appetite and the deadline, and where does the deadline come from? Which systems exist, what must we integrate with, who owns the data? How does the process run today — front stage, back stage, handoffs — and which pain points cost the most and happen most often? For every feature on the client's list: which problem, what evidence, which outcome? Which of the requested features survive that reframing? What must not get worse? What is the pilot group and what happens to the old process?

**`own`.** What is the vision in one sentence, and what change does it bring about? Who has the problem, and how do we know beyond ourselves? What are the three assumptions that, if false, make the product pointless — and what is the cheapest test for each? What result makes us stop? What is the one metric, the threshold, and the date? What are we deliberately not building?

**Common to all modes.** The domain glossary (the nouns and their owners). The business rules the product enforces and where they come from. The current and future key flows. The non-goals. The open questions, each marked blocking or not, each with the person who can answer it.
